| POST   | `/log`            | JWT (patient)   | Log mood — 10/day limit, encrypted journal; optional `recordedAt` backfills a missed day |
| GET    | `/today`          | JWT (patient)   | Already checked in today? (`?timezone=` IANA name)                                       |
| GET    | `/history`        | JWT (patient)   | Paginated history (`?startDate=`, `?endDate=`)                                           |
| GET    | `/summary`        | JWT (patient)   | Bucketed aggregates for the dashboard chart (`?granularity=day\|week\|month`)            |
| GET    | `/insights`       | JWT (patient)   | Weekly `time_bucket` trends (Redis cached 1h)                                            |
| GET    | `/report/:userId` | JWT (therapist) | Patient summary (no journal notes)                                                       |
| GET    | `/streak`         | JWT (patient)   | Consecutive check-in streak                                                              |
| PUT    | `/:id`            | JWT (patient)   | Edit own entry — content only, **not** `recordedAt`                                      |
| DELETE | `/:id`            | JWT (patient)   | Delete own entry                                                                         |

### Why `recordedAt` can't be edited

`mood_entries` is a TimescaleDB hypertable partitioned on `recorded_at`, with a
composite primary key `[id, recorded_at]`. Timescale rejects an `UPDATE` that
would move a row into a different chunk:

```
ERROR: new row for relation "_hyper_1_2_chunk" violates check constraint "constraint_2"
```

So changing when an entry happened means deleting it and logging a new one with
the corrected `recordedAt` (which `POST /log` accepts). The same composite key
is also why `PUT`/`DELETE` use Prisma's `updateMany`/`deleteMany` with a
`{ id, userId }` filter — `id` alone isn't a unique selector Prisma will accept,
and filtering on `userId` in the same statement enforces ownership without a
separate read-then-write.

### `/today` and time zones

"Today" is only answerable in the user's own zone — a Kigali user (UTC+3)
checking in at 01:00 local is still on the previous UTC day, so the UTC default
would be wrong for the first three hours of every day. Clients should send
`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`. The day-boundary helper
(`src/lib/local-day.ts`) is DST-correct — a spring-forward day resolves to a
23-hour range.

## RabbitMQ events

| Event            | Routing key    | Exchange       |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Concern          | `mood.concern` | `mindora.mood` |
| Streak milestone | `mood.streak`  | `mindora.mood` |

## Development

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis rabbitmq

# NOT `npm run db:migrate` — that targets the orphaned @mindora/database
# package, not this service's own DB (MOOD_DATABASE_URL)
cd apps/mood-tracking-service && npx prisma migrate dev
cd ../..

npm run seed -w @mindora/auth-service   # no root shortcut for this one yet
npm run db:seed:mood
npm run dev -w @mindora/mood-tracking-service
```

| `MOOD_DATABASE_URL`           | PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB — this was previously (and incorrectly) documented as `DATABASE_URL`; that's the orphaned `@mindora/database` package's variable, not this service's |
| `REDIS_URL`                   | Rate limit + insights cache                                                                                                                                                   |
