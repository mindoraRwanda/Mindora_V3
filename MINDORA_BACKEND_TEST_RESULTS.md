## Not executed

`npm ci`, `npm audit`, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, full `tsc` semantic builds, Prisma generation/migrations, Docker builds/Compose integration, and provider live tests were not executed. The available runtime was Node.js 22.16.0 (project requires 24.16.0), npm registry access was unavailable, and Docker was not installed in this execution environment.

Run the full locked CI workflow on GitHub Actions after pushing this update. Do not interpret these static checks as proof that the full build or production deployment passes.
